                Hi, I'm Austin.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm a web developer. Originally from the US, I have been making my way all around the world for the past 5 or 6 years. 
                I've lived in 5 different countries and many more places inside of those countries. Living all around the world has definitely
                been helped by my interest in learning new languages, speaking 4 different langauges at intermediate to fluent levels.
                Now, I'm turning that affinity for learning new languages onto coding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Iâ€™m an autonomous self-starter who is well-accustomed to working independently and remotely. Through my years of experience 
                teaching ESL, I have gained planning and project management skills, through creating and adjusting the curriculum to suit student 
                groups. I have also gained excellent written and verbal communication skills through learning to communicate effectively across language barriers.
